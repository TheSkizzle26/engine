A simple engine written in python using raylib.
Engine folder is expected to be in the root folder of the project.

Current functionality implemented:
    - elements
    - entities
    - camera
    - program class
    - scenes
    - asset loading
    - input mapping
    - event system
    - interactive foliage
    - particles
    - utility functions
    - log system (can be rendered)
    - rectangle collision detection

ToDo:
    - entity states
    - tilemap class
    - ui classes
    - extend/rewrite particles
    - maybe debug functionality?
    - maybe add documentation
